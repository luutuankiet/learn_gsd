<!--
LOOP CAPTURE - ideas, questions, concerns parked here.
Loops come from TWO sources:
1. User: Non-linear thinker, asks questions mid-task
2. Agent: Discovers dependencies, future work, concerns
-->

## How to Use

- Capture immediately when loop discovered
- Don't interrupt current task to address loop
- Review at phase end for next phase planning

## From User

<!-- User-initiated loops: questions, concerns, ideas during session -->

| # | Date | Loop | Source | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|--------|
| U1 | YYYY-MM-DD | [Question/concern] | Session N, Turn M | Open |

## From Agent

<!-- Agent-discovered loops: dependencies, risks, future work -->

| # | Date | Loop | Source | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|--------|
| A1 | YYYY-MM-DD | [Discovery/concern] | Phase N execution | Open |

## Resolved

<!-- Move here when addressed -->

| # | Resolution | Date |
|---|------------|------|
| U1 | [How resolved] | YYYY-MM-DD |

---
*Review before each phase promotion.*
