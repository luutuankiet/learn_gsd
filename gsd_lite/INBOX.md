<!--
LOOP CAPTURE - ideas, questions, concerns parked here.
All loops get systematic ID: LOOP-NNN (globally unique).

Loops come from TWO sources:
1. User: Non-linear thinker, asks questions mid-task
2. Agent: Discovers dependencies, future work, concerns
-->

## How to Use

- Capture immediately when loop discovered
- Assign next LOOP-NNN ID from STATE.md registry
- Don't interrupt current task to address loop
- Review at phase end for next phase planning
- User can reference by ID: "discuss LOOP-007"
