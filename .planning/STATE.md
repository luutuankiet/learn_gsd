# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-19)

**Core value:** Maintain ownership of the reasoning process - you stay the author who can explain the "why" behind every decision, not a passenger consuming agent output.
**Current focus:** Phase 1.5 - Evaluation Framework for GSD-lite

## Current Position

Phase: 1.5 of 6 (Evaluation Framework for GSD-lite)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-26 — Completed 01.5-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [██████░░░░] 60% (Phase 0-1.4 complete, 1.5 in progress)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 15
- Average duration: 3.4 min
- Total execution time: 0.86 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation & Templates | 4 | 22 min | 5.5 min |
| 1.2 Audit & Fix Template Coherence | 3 | 7 min | 2.3 min |
| 1.3 Context Lifecycle & Workflow Decomposition | 5 | 17.5 min | 3.5 min |
| 1.4 Enrich Checkpoint Workflow | 2 | 5.9 min | 3.0 min |
| 1.5 Evaluation Framework | 1 | 3 min | 3.0 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01.3-05 (4 min), 01.4-01 (2.8 min), 01.4-02 (3.1 min), 01.5-01 (3 min)
- Trend: Consistent velocity (~3 min per plan)

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 0 added retroactively: GSD Pattern Analysis (completed via Quick 001)
- Phase 1.1 inserted after Phase 1: Allow Flexible Token Budget (URGENT) - handle token budget flexibility discovered after Phase 1 completion
- Phase 1.2 inserted after Phase 1: Audit and fix template coherence for single-agent sessions (URGENT) - user found confusion when reading templates, must fix before Phase 2 uses them
- Phase 1.3 inserted after Phase 1.2: Context Lifecycle, Coaching Model & Workflow Decomposition (URGENT) - eval findings revealed context rot as core problem, need to document coaching philosophy and decompose protocol into per-workflow files
- Phase 1.4 inserted after Phase 1.3: Enrich Checkpoint Workflow (URGENT) - enhance checkpoint workflow discovered after Phase 1.3 completion
- Phase 1.5 inserted after Phase 1.4: Evaluation Framework for GSD-lite (URGENT) - build eval sequence with simulated repo, step-by-step prompts, reference responses, and eval notes for iterative QC

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Previous decisions preserved...]
- README context engineering rationale (01.4-02): Artifacts ultra-trimmed for agents, README provides reasoning/overview for humans (serves both audiences)
- Standard Library Only (01.5-01): Enforced no external dependencies for evaluation sandbox (portability/speed)
- Idempotent Load (01.5-01): DB load step clears data to support repeated test runs

### Pending Todos

1. **Create evaluation scenario for testing gsd-lite iterations** - Build test scenario to validate gsd-lite behavior across iterations. (Started in Phase 1.5)

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
