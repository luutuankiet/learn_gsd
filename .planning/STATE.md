# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-19)

**Core value:** Maintain ownership of the reasoning process - you stay the author who can explain the "why" behind every decision, not a passenger consuming agent output.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Templates

## Current Position

Phase: 1.2 of 6 (Audit and Fix Template Coherence for Single-Agent Sessions)
Plan: 3 of 3 (Phase 1.2 complete)
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-23 — Completed 01.2-03-PLAN.md (cleanup and verification)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33% (Phase 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 1.2 complete, Phase 0.1 skipped, Phase 1.1 pending)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 4.0 min
- Total execution time: 0.47 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation & Templates | 4 | 22 min | 5.5 min |
| 1.2 Audit & Fix Template Coherence | 3 | 7 min | 2.3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-04 (4 min), 01.2-02 (2 min), 01.2-01 (2 min), 01.2-03 (3 min)
- Trend: Excellent velocity (2-4 min per plan, averaging 4.0 min)

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 0 added retroactively: GSD Pattern Analysis (completed via Quick 001)
- Phase 0.1 inserted after Phase 0: Integrate GSD Patterns (URGENT) - reflect Quick 001 findings into planning docs before Phase 1
- Phase 1.1 inserted after Phase 1: Allow Flexible Token Budget (URGENT) - handle token budget flexibility discovered after Phase 1 completion
- Phase 1.2 inserted after Phase 1: Audit and fix template coherence for single-agent sessions (URGENT) - user found confusion when reading templates, must fix before Phase 2 uses them

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap creation: Derived 4 phases from 18 v1 requirements (Quick depth)
- Roadmap structure: Foundation → Session Handoff → Context Engineering → Educational Integration & Validation
- GSD pattern adoption (Quick 001): XML structure for LOOPS/CONTEXT templates, conservative token budgets (20/40/50%), checkpoint thinking for workflows
- Session artifact organization: Use .project/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-description/ structure
- Systematic ID format (01-01): TYPE-NNN for global unique references (LOOP-007, TASK-003, DECISION-008)
- Token budget thresholds (01-01): 0-20% comfortable, 20-40% deliberate, 40-50% warning, 50%+ stop
- Progressive loading strategy (01-01): Start narrow, expand deliberately, exclude proactively
- Context stack depth limit (01-01): Single level only to prevent cognitive overload
- Sticky note frequency (01-02): Include when artifact updated OR actions changed, omit when nothing changed
- Dual workflow support (01-02): All templates provide MCP and copy-paste instructions (vendor agnostic)
- GTD export mapping (01-02): Closed loops → achievements, Open → next actions, Clarifying → waiting for
- Template educational style (01-02): Inline comments throughout, not dumped at end
- Protocol reference pattern (01-03): Separate quick-lookup doc consolidating enforcement mechanisms from all templates
- AGENTS.md standard adoption (01-03): Follow agents.md format for cross-platform compatibility
- Checkpoint categorization (01-03): Split into informational (progress) vs blocking (requires action)
- Sticky note inclusion rules (01-03): Include when artifact/state/actions changed, omit for pure conversation
- Namespace correction (01-04): Use .gsd-lite/ instead of .planning/ to avoid namespace conflict
- Mermaid diagrams (01-04): Use Mermaid over ASCII for workflow/sequence diagrams (maintainability, interactivity)
- Loop sources (01-04): Loops originate from both agent discovery AND user questions during checkpoints/decisions
- Window-relative token budgets (01-04): Thresholds relative to context window (Claude 40/50%, Gemini 50/60%)
- Template distribution approach (Quick 002): Manual git clone + copy as primary method, avoid npx/pip (wrong tools for markdown)
- PROTOCOL.md immutability (01.2-01): Agents read but never write to protocol file
- Single-read constraint (01.2-01): Agents can only read files at first turn, requiring self-contained protocol
- 10x emoji moodboard mandatory (01.2-01): Visual banner required for every new phase planning
- Dual-source loop capture (01.2-01): Loops from both user (non-linear thinking) and agent (discovery)
- Aggressive WORK.md trimming (01.2-01): After promotion, WORK.md deleted (not archived)
- STATE.md depth level (01.2-02): Moderate depth with Key Decisions table for weak agent resume
- WORK.md ephemeral pattern (01.2-02): Explicitly marked as deleted after phase promotion
- INBOX.md dual sources (01.2-02): Separate sections for user loops (non-linear) and agent loops (discovery)
- HISTORY.md minimal format (01.2-02): One line per completed phase with external artifact links
- Systematic IDs across artifacts (01.2-03): TYPE-NNN format (PHASE/TASK/LOOP/DECISION) with ID Registry in STATE.md
- User-controlled phase completion (01.2-03): Agent signals readiness, user decides when to promote (prevents premature WORK.md trimming)
- Artifact update timing (01.2-03): STATE.md and WORK.md updated after EVERY turn (not occasionally)
- Sticky note checkpoint banners (01.2-03): 6 informational checkpoint types with distinct emojis, plus action menu
