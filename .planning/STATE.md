# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-19)

**Core value:** Maintain ownership of the reasoning process - you stay the author who can explain the "why" behind every decision, not a passenger consuming agent output.
**Current focus:** Phase 1.7 - Refactor Artifacts for Grep Synergy

## Current Position

Phase: 1.7 of 6 (Refactor Artifacts for Grep Synergy)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (Complete)
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-27 — Completed 01.7-02-PLAN.md

Progress: [████████░░] 72% (Phase 0-1.7 complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 18
- Average duration: 3.6 min
- Total execution time: 1.15 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation & Templates | 4 | 22 min | 5.5 min |
| 1.2 Audit & Fix Template Coherence | 3 | 7 min | 2.3 min |
| 1.3 Context Lifecycle & Workflow Decomposition | 5 | 17.5 min | 3.5 min |
| 1.4 Enrich Checkpoint Workflow | 2 | 5.9 min | 3.0 min |
| 1.5 Evaluation Framework | 2 | 8 min | 4.0 min |
| 1.7 Refactor Artifacts for Grep Synergy | 2 | 13 min | 6.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01.5-01 (3 min), 01.5-02 (5 min), 01.7-01 (5 min), 01.7-02 (8 min)
- Trend: Consistent velocity (~3-8 min per plan)

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 0 added retroactively: GSD Pattern Analysis (completed via Quick 001)
- Phase 1.1 inserted after Phase 1: Allow Flexible Token Budget (URGENT) - handle token budget flexibility discovered after Phase 1 completion
- Phase 1.2 inserted after Phase 1: Audit and fix template coherence for single-agent sessions (URGENT) - user found confusion when reading templates, must fix before Phase 2 uses them
- Phase 1.3 inserted after Phase 1.2: Context Lifecycle, Coaching Model & Workflow Decomposition (URGENT) - eval findings revealed context rot as core problem, need to document coaching philosophy and decompose protocol into per-workflow files
- Phase 1.4 inserted after Phase 1.3: Enrich Checkpoint Workflow (URGENT) - enhance checkpoint workflow discovered after Phase 1.3 completion
- Phase 1.5 inserted after Phase 1.4: Evaluation Framework for GSD-lite (URGENT) - build eval sequence with simulated repo, step-by-step prompts, reference responses, and eval notes for iterative QC
- Phase 1.6 inserted after Phase 1.5: Fix agent overriding examples in scaffolded file (URGENT) - commands are under ~/.config/opencode
- Phase 1.7 inserted after Phase 1.6: Refactor artifacts and protocols and workflows to synergy with grep (URGENT)

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Previous decisions preserved...]
- README context engineering rationale (01.4-02): Artifacts ultra-trimmed for agents, README provides reasoning/overview for humans (serves both audiences)
- Standard Library Only (01.5-01): Enforced no external dependencies for evaluation sandbox (portability/speed)
- Idempotent Load (01.5-01): DB load step clears data to support repeated test runs
- WORK.md perpetual lifecycle (01.7-01): WORK.md is now perpetual with user-controlled housekeeping, not ephemeral
- STATE.md deprecated (01.7-01): State tracking merged into WORK.md Current Understanding section
- housekeeping.md workflow (01.7-01): Unified workflow for PR extraction and archiving, replaces promotion.md
- Grep-first behavior (01.7-01): PROTOCOL.md teaches grep patterns and read_to_next_pattern with fallbacks
- Pair programming philosophy (01.7-02): All workflows transformed from hierarchical "task executor" to collaborative "thinking partner"
- First Turn Protocol (01.7-02): Agents must talk to user before writing artifacts on first turn
- Confirmation loops (01.7-02): All workflows end substantive responses with [YOUR TURN] explicit handoffs

### Pending Todos

1. **Run evaluations using the new framework** - Execute the scenario with Claude Sonnet/Gemini Pro and grade them. (Next step)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
