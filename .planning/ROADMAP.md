# Roadmap: Data Engineering Copilot Patterns

## Overview

Build a knowledge base of vendor-agnostic patterns for using AI copilots in data engineering workflows. Establish file-based protocols and heavily-commented templates that teach both GSD mechanics and data engineering patterns. Ship session handoff system first (eliminate 15-30 min context reconstruction), then layer in context engineering patterns (handling 200+ model lineages), and validate on real dbt refactoring work.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

## Phase Details

### Phase 0: GSD Pattern Analysis
**Goal**: Analyze Get-Shit-Done framework patterns for application to data engineering copilot workflows
**Depends on**: Nothing (initial setup)
**Requirements**: None (discovery/research phase)
**Status**: Completed via Quick Task 001

**Completed work:**
- Created `gsd_reference/` directory (89 files, reference copy of .claude)
- Created `.planning/GSD_PATTERNS.md` (647 lines, comprehensive pattern analysis)
- Identified 8 core GSD patterns with rationale
- Created phase-specific integration roadmap for Phases 1-4
- Made key decisions: XML structure, conservative token budgets (20/40/50%), checkpoint thinking

### Phase 1: Foundation & Templates
**Goal**: Establish file-based protocol and heavily-commented template approach that works across all agent types
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: META-01, META-02

**Depends on**: Phase 1.2
**Requirements**: None (architecture/vision work)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Context lifecycle documented (when to checkpoint, when to clear, how to resume)
  2. Coaching philosophy articulated (user owns outcome, agent is thinking partner)
  3. PROTOCOL.md decomposed into per-workflow files under `src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/`
  4. Sticky note protocol included in ALL workflow files (universal orientation)
  5. All ASCII art removed, replaced with markdown headers + mermaid diagrams
