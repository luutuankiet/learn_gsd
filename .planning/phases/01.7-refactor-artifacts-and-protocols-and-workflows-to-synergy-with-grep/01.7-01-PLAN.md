<objective>
Restructure WORK.md for grep-optimized retrieval and merge STATE.md tracking into WORK.md.

Purpose: Enable non-linear retrieval via single-line grep patterns. Fresh agents can grep headers/tags first, then surgical read of relevant sections. Eliminate STATE.md as separate file to reduce confusion for weak agents.

Output:
- WORK.md template with 3-part structure (Current Understanding, Key Events Index, Atomic Log)
- PROTOCOL.md updated to reflect merged structure and housekeeping workflow
- housekeeping.md workflow replacing promotion.md
- STATE.md marked as deprecated
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign WORK.md with 3-part grep-friendly structure</name>
  <files>src/gsd_lite/template/WORK.md</files>
  <action>
Replace WORK.md template with new 3-part structure:

**Part 1: Current Understanding (Read First)**
- 30-second handoff section at top (from checkpoint workflow)
- Include: Active Task, Parked Tasks, Vision, Decisions, Blockers, Next Action
- Keep Current Mode tracking (formerly in STATE.md)

**Part 2: Key Events Index (Query Accelerator)**
- Table with columns: Log ID | Type | Task | Summary
- Example: `| LOG-015 | DECISION | MODEL-A | Use card-based layout over timeline |`
- One-line summaries only (10 words max)
- Updated for "major" entries (VISION, DECISION, BLOCKER, DISCOVERY with code)

**Part 3: Atomic Session Log (Chronological)**
- Format: `[LOG-NNN] - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [TYPE] - Task: TASK-ID`
- Types: VISION, DECISION, DISCOVERY, PLAN, BLOCKER, EXEC
- Each entry includes: Summary line + Details with code snippets
- Code snippets ALWAYS included for EXEC and DISCOVERY entries

**CRITICAL changes:**
- Remove "ephemeral" language - WORK.md is now perpetual
- Remove "deleted after promotion" - replaced with housekeeping workflow
- Add multi-task support with Task: TAG in every log entry
- Keep examples but update to show [LOG-NNN] format with 6 types
- Include grep pattern hints in comments (^## for headers, [LOG-NNN] for ID lookup)
  </action>
  <verify>
Run grep patterns against new template:
- `grep "^## " WORK.md` finds 3 section headers
- Template contains [LOG-NNN] format examples
- No references to "ephemeral" or "deleted after promotion"
  </verify>
  <done>
WORK.md template has 3-part structure optimized for grep discovery, perpetual lifecycle, and multi-task support.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create housekeeping.md workflow replacing promotion.md</name>
  <files>src/gsd_lite/template/workflows/housekeeping.md</files>
  <action>
Create new housekeeping.md workflow that unifies PR extraction AND archiving:

**Entry Conditions:**
- User requests "write PR" or "clean up WORK.md" or "archive old entries"
- Natural language triggers, not mode-based

**Housekeeping Operations:**

1. **PR Extraction** (user: "write PR for MODEL-A")
   - Filter WORK.md logs by Task: TAG
   - Extract DECISION, DISCOVERY (with code), EXEC entries
   - Generate PR description with evidence from logs
   - Keep entries in WORK.md (not deleted)

2. **Archive to HISTORY.md** (user: "archive MODEL-A" or "clean up WORK.md")
   - Move completed task entries to HISTORY.md
   - Keep HISTORY.md minimal (one-liner per task/phase)
   - Full logs optionally saved to dated files if user wants

3. **Index Maintenance**
   - After archiving, remove corresponding rows from Key Events Index
   - Update Current Understanding to reflect active tasks only

**Key Differences from promotion.md:**
- NOT triggered by mode/state - user initiates with natural language
- Does NOT delete WORK.md - only archives specific entries
- Can be run multiple times (not once per phase)
- WORK.md is perpetual - housekeeping maintains it, doesn't destroy it

Include Coaching Philosophy section (pair programming framing) and Sticky Note Protocol.
  </action>
  <verify>
- housekeeping.md exists with PR extraction and archive operations
- No references to "delete WORK.md" or "trim WORK.md"
- Natural language trigger examples included
- `grep "housekeeping" src/gsd_lite/template/PROTOCOL.md` returns match (confirms wiring in router)
  </verify>
  <done>
housekeeping.md workflow created, replacing promotion workflow with perpetual WORK.md management.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update PROTOCOL.md for merged structure and new router</name>
  <files>src/gsd_lite/template/PROTOCOL.md, src/gsd_lite/template/STATE.md</files>
  <action>
Update PROTOCOL.md:

1. **File Guide section:**
   - Remove STATE.md from file list (merged into WORK.md)
   - Update WORK.md description to "Session state + execution log"
   - Add note: "STATE.md deprecated - state tracking now in WORK.md Current Understanding"

2. **Workflow Router:**
   - Replace `promotion.md` with `housekeeping.md` in primary routing
   - Change promotion trigger to `housekeeping` mode
   - Add secondary routing for "write PR" and "clean up" triggers

3. **Fresh Agent Resume Protocol:**
   - Update to read WORK.md only (not STATE.md)
   - Reference "Current Understanding section in WORK.md" instead of STATE.md
   - Update sequence: Read PROTOCOL.md → Read WORK.md Current Understanding → Load workflow

4. **Update STATE.md file:**
   - Replace content with deprecation notice using this wording:
     ```
     # STATE.md (DEPRECATED)

     This file is deprecated. State tracking now in WORK.md Current Understanding section.

     See WORK.md template for details.
     ```
   - Keep file for backward compatibility but mark obsolete

5. **Remove ephemeral references:**
   - Remove any mention of "WORK.md is ephemeral"
   - Update context lifecycle section to reflect perpetual WORK.md
  </action>
  <verify>
- PROTOCOL.md router includes housekeeping.md, not promotion.md
- Fresh Agent Resume Protocol references WORK.md only
- STATE.md contains deprecation notice
- No references to ephemeral WORK.md
  </verify>
  <done>
PROTOCOL.md updated with merged file structure, new router, and perpetual WORK.md lifecycle.
  </done>
</task>

After all tasks complete:

1. Grep pattern tests:
   - `grep "^## " src/gsd_lite/template/WORK.md` returns 3+ headers

   - `grep "ephemeral" src/gsd_lite/template/*.md` returns 0 results
   - `grep "promotion.md" src/gsd_lite/template/PROTOCOL.md` returns 0 results

2. File structure:
   - WORK.md has 3-part structure
   - housekeeping.md exists
   - STATE.md contains deprecation notice
   - PROTOCOL.md router updated
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- WORK.md template redesigned with grep-friendly 3-part structure
- STATE.md merged into WORK.md (deprecated as separate file)

- PROTOCOL.md updated to reflect new structure
- No "ephemeral" language remains in artifacts
- All grep patterns from RESEARCH.md work against new templates
