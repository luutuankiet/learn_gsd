# Phase 1.7: Refactor Artifacts for Grep Synergy - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Restructure all GSD-lite artifacts (WORK.md, STATE.md, protocols, workflows) for two goals:

1. **Grep synergy** — Key information discoverable via single-line grep patterns. Enable non-linear retrieval — agents grep headers/tags first, then surgical read of relevant lines. WORK.md becomes perpetual (not ephemeral), with user-controlled housekeeping to archive old entries.

2. **Pair programming philosophy** — Revamp coaching philosophy from "User = visionary, Agent = builder" to "User + Agent = thinking partners exploring together." Agent as navigator (proposes hypotheses, challenges assumptions, teaches with analogies), user as driver.

**This phase is about:**
- Organizing content for grep/search workflows with `uvx fs-mcp` tools
- Revamping agent behavior to be collaborative explorer, not task executor
- Ensuring all templates and workflows are coherent after these changes

## Implementation Decisions

### Coaching Philosophy Revamp (CRITICAL)

**Old framing (remove):** "User = visionary. Agent = builder."
**New framing:** "User + Agent = thinking partners exploring together."

Agent operates as **navigator**, user remains **driver**.

**Core behaviors to encode in all workflows:**

1. **Propose hypotheses** — Agent says "What if we tried X?" for user to react to, not just receives instructions
2. **Challenge assumptions** — Agent asks "Why do you think that?" and "Have you considered Y?" — pushes user to think
3. **Teach with analogies** — Agent explains concepts with relatable mental models (like "Road Map vs Road Trip")
4. **Celebrate discoveries** — Agent highlights "aha" moments: "Exactly! 🌟 You nailed it"
5. **Transparent reasoning** — Agent explains WHY it's asking a question or suggesting a path
6. **Treat errors as learning** — Failures become learning moments, not just bugs to fix
7. **Validate first** — Acknowledge correct logic before giving feedback or corrections
8. **Mandatory confirmation loops** — End responses with "[YOUR TURN]" or explicit handoff to user
9. **Handle frustration** — Switch from Socratic to direct explanation when user is stuck, then resume guided inquiry

**What to REMOVE from workflows:**
- "User owns outcome. Agent executes." (too hierarchical)
- "Never expand scope mid-phase" (treats exploration as failure)
- "Scope creep → Capture to INBOX" (parks interesting threads instead of exploring them)
- Any framing of agent as task-doer rather than thinking partner

**Reference:** prompt_guided_learning.md (full guided learning prompt)

### First Turn Protocol (Bug Fix)

**Problem:** Agent reads artifacts on first turn and writes moodboard content INTO INBOX.md instead of talking to user.

**Fix:** Agent ALWAYS talks to user first before writing to any artifact.

**First turn sequence:**
1. Read PROTOCOL.md (silently)
2. Read WORK.md Current Understanding (silently)
3. **TALK to user:** "Here's what I understand from the artifacts... What would you like to explore today?"
4. Only write to artifacts AFTER conversing with user

**Never on first turn:**
- Write to INBOX.md
- Propose a plan without discussing
- Start executing without understanding context

### Log Entry Format
- Use `[LOG-NNN]` prefix for all log entries (sequential, zero-padded)
- Each entry includes: timestamp, type tag, task tag, summary, details with code
- **Always include code snippets** in EXEC/DISCOVERY logs — maximum context for PR extraction

### Log Type Taxonomy (6 types)
- `[VISION]` — Goals, what success looks like
- `[DECISION]` — Choices made with rationale
- `[DISCOVERY]` — Evidence, findings, data (with code snippets)
- `[PLAN]` — Strategy, approach chosen
- `[BLOCKER]` — Issues, pivots, what didn't work
- `[EXEC]` — Concrete actions taken (with code snippets)

### File Structure Changes
- **Merge STATE.md into WORK.md** — fewer files = less confusion for weak agents
- WORK.md structure:
  1. Current Understanding (handoff header)
  2. Key Events Index (grep accelerator table)
  3. Session Log (chronological, atomic entries)
- Deprecate STATE.md — remove from templates

### Multi-Task Support in WORK.md
- Each log entry tagged with Task: `[LOG-017] - [timestamp] - [VISION] - Task: MODEL-C`
- Index table includes Task column for filtering
- Current Understanding shows: Active Task + Parked tasks

### Housekeeping Workflow (Replaces Promotion)
- Single workflow handles both PR extraction AND archiving
- User triggers with natural language: "write PR for MODEL-A" or "clean up WORK.md"
- Archived entries move to HISTORY.md
- WORK.md is now **perpetual** — not deleted after promotion

### Grep Pattern Design
- All patterns are **single-line only** (simpler, more portable)
- No multiline grep required — use "grep line number → read section" workflow
- Key patterns:
  - Header discovery: `^## `
  - Log ID lookup: `^\[LOG-028\]`
  - Type filtering: `\[DECISION\]`
  - Task filtering: `Task: MODEL-A`

### Template Coherence Updates Required
- PROTOCOL.md — update file references, remove ephemeral WORK.md language
- WORK.md template — new 3-part structure
- All workflow files — update for perpetual WORK.md, merged housekeeping
- STATE.md — deprecate (merged into WORK.md)

### Testing with fs-mcp
- Create golden sample WORK.md (50-100 lines) with all log types
- Spin up `uvx fs-mcp` server, send real grep queries via stdio
- Test cases:
  1. Header discovery: `^## ` finds all section headers
  2. Log ID lookup: `[LOG-NNN]` finds specific entry
  3. Type filtering: `[DECISION]` finds all decisions
  4. Task filtering: `Task: MODEL-A` finds task-specific entries

### README Update
- Update README to reflect new architecture (perpetual WORK.md, merged STATE, housekeeping workflow)
- Document the grep-first workflow pattern for agents
- Update artifact lifecycle diagram

### Final Coherence Verification (Regression Prevention)
- **Cross-reference check:** All workflow files must reference the same artifact names and structures
- **No orphan references:** Remove all references to deprecated STATE.md
- **No conflicting instructions:** Ensure no workflow says "delete WORK.md" or "ephemeral"
- **Consistent log format:** All examples in all files use [LOG-NNN] format with 6 types
- **Human walkthrough:** User reads through all updated templates to verify coherence

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact formatting of the Key Events Index table
- How to handle edge cases in log ID sequencing
- Structure of HISTORY.md archive entries
- Error handling in test harness

## Specific Ideas

- "I like the verbose logging in WORK.prod.md — include code snippets, full context"
- "The goal is context condensing — fresh agent can read logs and one-shot write PR"
- "Agent should grep headers first (^## ) to discover structure, then surgical read"
- "Think of WORK.md as a simple database — grep to find, read to retrieve"
- "I treat agents like pair programmers — throwing ideas back and forth, creating hypotheses, verifying them, having fun learning, documenting the journey"
- "The last thing I want is an agent that jumps straight to proposing a 'fix' without interviewing me, without pushing ME to think"

**References:**
- WORK.prod.md (production session artifact)
- suggestions.md (V2 proposal for grep-friendly structure)
- prod_session.md (detailed session flow showing pair programming in action)
- prompt_guided_learning.md (guided learning prompt with Socratic method, analogies, confirmation loops)
