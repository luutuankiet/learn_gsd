<current_state>
Phase 0.1 planning just completed. The gsd-planner agent created 1 executable plan (00.1-01-PLAN.md) that integrates GSD pattern findings from Quick Task 001 into the planning documents.

Plan status: Created, not yet executed
Verification: Not yet run (--skip-verify was not used, but checker hasn't run yet)
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Planning session:**
- ✓ Validated Phase 0.1 in ROADMAP.md
- ✓ Confirmed phase directory exists (.planning/phases/00.1-integrate-gsd-patterns/)
- ✓ Skipped research (--skip-research flag used - integration work doesn't need domain research)
- ✓ Spawned gsd-planner agent with context (STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, GSD_PATTERNS.md)
- ✓ Planner returned PLANNING COMPLETE with 1 plan

**Plan created:**
- 00.1-01-PLAN.md: Integrate GSD Pattern Findings
  - Wave 1, autonomous, no dependencies
  - 3 tasks: Update PROJECT.md decisions, update ROADMAP.md phases, review REQUIREMENTS.md
  - Context budget: ~40% (reading GSD_PATTERNS.md + updating 3 docs)

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Immediate next steps:**
1. Run gsd-plan-checker to verify the plan (was interrupted before verification step)
2. Execute the plan via /gsd:execute-phase 0.1
3. Verify phase completion

**Plan execution (00.1-01-PLAN.md):**
- Task 1: Update PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with GSD pattern adoption decisions
- Task 2: Update ROADMAP.md Phase 1-4 details with GSD integration roadmap applications
- Task 3: Review and update REQUIREMENTS.md based on GSD patterns (add HANDOFF-07 if needed)

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**During planning:**
- Skipped research phase (--skip-research flag) because Phase 0.1 is integration work, not domain research - we already have GSD_PATTERNS.md from Quick Task 001
- Single autonomous plan approach: All integration tasks bundled into one plan since they're tightly coupled (all updating planning docs based on same source)
- Conservative context budget (40%): Plan reads one large doc (GSD_PATTERNS.md) and updates 3 planning docs

**From Quick Task 001 (to be integrated by this phase):**
- XML structure for LOOPS/CONTEXT templates
- Conservative token budgets: 20/40/50% for different complexity levels
- Checkpoint thinking for workflows
- Session artifact organization: .project/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-description/

None - planning completed successfully, ready to execute.

**What happened:**
User invoked /gsd:plan-phase 0.1 --skip-research. The orchestrator validated Phase 0.1, confirmed the phase directory exists, skipped research (as requested), and spawned the gsd-planner agent. The planner analyzed the phase goal and success criteria, then created a single autonomous plan to integrate GSD pattern findings into PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, and REQUIREMENTS.md.

The planner was about to proceed to the verification step (spawning gsd-plan-checker) when the user interrupted with /help, then immediately called /gsd:pause-work.

**The approach:**
Phase 0.1 is a critical bridge phase - it takes the patterns discovered in Quick Task 001 and weaves them into the formal planning documents before Phase 1 execution begins. This ensures Phase 1 (Foundation & Templates) can reference specific GSD patterns that are already documented in the roadmap.

The plan is intentionally simple (1 plan, 3 tasks, wave 1) because this is documentation integration work, not code implementation. The tasks are sequential within the plan but can execute autonomously without user checkpoints.

**Mental model:**
Think of this as "closing the loop" from Quick 001. We did exploratory work, documented patterns in GSD_PATTERNS.md, and now we need to formalize those decisions in the canonical planning docs (PROJECT.md decisions table, ROADMAP.md phase details, REQUIREMENTS.md).

<next_action>

When resuming, you have two options:

**Option 1: Verify then execute (recommended)**
1. Continue the interrupted planning flow by spawning gsd-plan-checker to verify 00.1-01-PLAN.md
2. If verification passes, proceed to /gsd:execute-phase 0.1
3. If issues found, iterate with planner

**Option 2: Skip verification and execute**
The plan is simple enough that you could skip verification and go straight to:
/gsd:execute-phase 0.1

**Specific first action:**
Read 00.1-01-PLAN.md to understand what the executor will do, then decide whether to verify or execute directly.
